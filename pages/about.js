            Passion. Experience. Diligence. Our desire to build RemoteIndia was
            born from our personal challenges in hiring great talent for our own
            ventures. We have collectively founded several firms in the US,
            taken one through an IPO, led large engineering teams at Fortune-50
            firms through strategic transformations, and overseen many projects
            across multiple geographies. Throughout all of these, our biggest
            challenge has remained consistent - finding the best talent for a
            job - quickly and cost-effectively. We have found recruiting talent
            through our referral network to be the most successful approach, and
            we have built RemoteIndia around the concept of recruiting through
            referrals at scale. We leverage the same approach for sales as well
            - our clients find us through referrals and make us successful
            because we help them find talent that is most suitable for their
            immediate and long-term needs.
